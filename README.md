# Component boilerplate
Simple and straightforward boilerplate for making components. Meant to be used with Brackets and Live Reload.

Feel free to use [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) for designing right in browser. Just uncomment the Tachyons import and go ahead.

## Requirements
 - Git
 - BEM

## Workflow
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone the forked repo
3. Open `index.html` in Brackets
4. Enable Live Reload
5. __Build component with BEM__. Feel free to adjust container as you need.
6. Create pull-request

## Guidelines
 - __Keep it mobile-first.__  
Open devtools and choose narrow viewport (around 500 px wide). Your component should not misbehave at any viewport width.
 - __Keep it BEM.__  
Separate BEM namespaces allows components to be truly independent and replaceable.
